## Player Instructions

This is a card matching game. There are 16 cards for a total of 8 matches. The game ends when a player successfully
matches all  8 pairs. 

To begin the game, click on a card. The game timer will start counting up, showing the number of seconds and minutes that have passed 
since the first card click.

When the symbols on two cards are a match, they will turn turquoise and remain open. If the two cards are not a match, 
they will turn purple, then flip back over. Remember where they were! 

The moves counter will display the number of moves the player has made.

The star rating will display from 1 to 3 stars which reflect the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, 
it will display 3 stars. After a certain number of moves, a star will be removed for a lower rating. After a few more moves, 
it will lower to 1 star.

The restart button will refresh the game board, the timer, the move counter, and the star rating.

When a player wins the game, a Congratulations window will pop up and offer the option to play again.
